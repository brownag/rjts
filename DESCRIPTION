Version: 0.1.1
Author: Andrew G. Brown
Maintainer: Andrew G. Brown <brown.andrewg@gmail.com>
Description: The Java Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source library of spatial predicates and functions for processing geometries. <https://github.com/locationtech/jts> 
    'JTS' provides a complete, consistent, and robust implementation of fundamental algorithms for processing linear geometry on the 2-dimensional Cartesian plane. It also provides a comprehensive set of geometry test cases, and the 'TestBuilder' GUI application for working with and visualizing geometry and 'JTS' functions.
